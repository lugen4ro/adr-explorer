# ADR-001: Database Choice for User Management

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2024-12-15

## Context
We need to choose a database solution for storing user data, authentication information, and application state. The application will need to handle user registration, login, profile management, and session storage.

## Decision
We will use PostgreSQL as our primary database for the following reasons:

1. **ACID compliance**: Ensures data integrity for user transactions
2. **JSON support**: Native JSON columns for flexible user preferences storage
3. **Scalability**: Proven track record for handling large user bases
4. **Rich ecosystem**: Extensive tooling and community support
5. **Full-text search**: Built-in search capabilities for user content

## Consequences

### Positive
- Strong consistency guarantees for critical user data
- Mature ecosystem with excellent ORM support
- Good performance characteristics for read-heavy workloads
- Native JSON support reduces need for document database

### Negative
- Requires more setup and maintenance than simpler alternatives
- Higher resource requirements than lightweight databases
- Need to manage database migrations and schema changes

## Implementation Notes
- Use connection pooling for better performance
- Implement proper indexing strategy for user queries
- Set up automated backups and point-in-time recovery
- Consider read replicas for scaling read operations
