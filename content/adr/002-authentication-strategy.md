# ADR-002: Authentication Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2024-12-16

## Context
The application requires a secure authentication system to handle user registration, login, password reset, and session management. We need to balance security, user experience, and implementation complexity.

## Decision
We will implement a JWT-based authentication system with the following components:

1. **JWT tokens** for stateless authentication
2. **Refresh token rotation** for enhanced security
3. **bcrypt** for password hashing
4. **Rate limiting** on authentication endpoints
5. **Multi-factor authentication** support

## Alternatives Considered

### Session-based Authentication
- **Pros**: Simple to implement, server-side control
- **Cons**: Requires session storage, not suitable for microservices

### OAuth 2.0 with External Providers
- **Pros**: No password management, established trust
- **Cons**: Vendor lock-in, limited customization

### Passwordless Authentication
- **Pros**: Better security, improved UX
- **Cons**: Dependency on email/SMS delivery, user adoption challenges

## Consequences

### Positive
- Stateless tokens enable horizontal scaling
- Secure password storage with industry-standard hashing
- Refresh token rotation limits exposure window
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- MFA support enhances security for sensitive accounts

### Negative
- Token management complexity (storage, rotation, revocation)
- Requires careful handling of token expiration
- Need to implement token blacklisting for logout
- Additional complexity for MFA implementation

## Implementation Details
- Access tokens: 15-minute expiration
- Refresh tokens: 7-day expiration with rotation
- Password requirements: 12+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols
- Rate limiting: 5 attempts per minute per IP
- MFA: TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) support
